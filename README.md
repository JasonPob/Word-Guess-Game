# Word-Guess-Game

I created a word guess game (hangman) that accepts user key stokes in order to play. In the event of a win/loss the game will alert the user of the game status and refresh the current game. 

Design:
The game consists of two main functions. The first, named gameReset sets the parameters for a fresh new game. The second function accepts user key strokes to be used in the game.
